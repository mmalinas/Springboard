# Modeling the Characteristics of Airport Travelers

This is the code and data for my first capstone project, "Modeling the Characteristics of Airport Travelers". In this project, I analyzed San Francisco International Airport survey data and used machine learning to build a model to distinguish between business and non-business travelers. I achieved an F1 score of 0.591 using logistic regression with upsampling.
